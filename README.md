# Modelling Epidemics

COVID-19 has triggered creation of this repository. This repository would contain notebooks that analyze epidemic from different viewpoints. This is open for contribution and to build upon ideas.

**Warning** : I'm not an epidemiologist, infectious disease expert and would have made errors. Please do let me know of errors if you find. These are right now of "play" quality. Also, i have heavily borrowed ideas.

These terms have now gotten into our vocabulary,
* Flatten the Curve
* Lockdown
* Social Distancing
* Quarantine (self, medical, apartment)
* Aggressive Test strategy

For Math lowers,
* R0
* BRN
* SEIR
* Exponential

These notebooks will help you understand the impact better.
